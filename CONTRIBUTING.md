# Contributing Guidelines
Welcome to Curewell Homeo Clinic Admin System Contributing Guidelines, glad you made it here and thanks a lot for your interest in the project.
> Your contribution in any way is very much appreciated.

## Things to keep in mind while contributing.
- Make sure to check and pass the basic test github action.
- If you're adding a new feature write unit-tests for it.
- This project is not for developers but is being used by the actual organization and if your contribution is accepted make it is likely to be deployed in production, so make sure the chages you propose production ready.
- Make sure to write brief commit messages if required a detailed description use the commit description instead of actual message.
- Write a brief but to the point Pull Request and Issue description while creating them.
